            <p id="bodytext">Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
                    I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
                    She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
                    In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
                    Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
                    Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
                    Didn't make sense not to live for fun
                    Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
                    So much to do, so much to see
                    So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
                    You'll never know if you don't go
                    You'll never shine if you don't glow
                    Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
                    Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
                    And all that glitters is gold
                    Only shooting stars break the mold
                    It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
                    You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
                    But the meteor men beg to differ
                    Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
                    The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
                    The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
                    My world's on fire, how about yours?
                    That's the way I like it and I never get bored
                    Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
                    Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
                    All that glitters is gold
                    Only shooting stars break the mold
                    Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
                    Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid
                    And all that glitters is gold
                    Only shooting stars
                    Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
                    I need to get myself away from this place
                    I said yep what a concept
                    I could use a little fuel myself
                    And we could all use a little change
                    Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
                    Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
                    Didn't make sense not to live for fun
                    Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
                    So much to do, so much to see
                    So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
                    You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
                    You'll never shine if you don't glow
                    Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
                    Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
                    And all that glitters is gold

                    And all that glitters is gold
                    Only shooting stars break the mold</p>
